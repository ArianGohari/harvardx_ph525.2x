# Exercise 3: Which of the following can't be written as linear model?
# -> Y = a + b^t + e

# Exercise 4: Suppose you model the relationship between weight and height 
# across individuals with a linear model. You assume that the height of 
# individuals for a fixed weight x follows a linear model Y = a + bx + e.
# Which of the following best describes what e represents?
# 
# -> Between-individual variability: people of the same weight vary 
# in their height.
